# Movie Recommendation System
This project cleans and manipulates metadata for over 45000 movies to make recommendation for users.
Currently, it has a simple recommendation which recommend movies based on ratings and generas and a content-based recommendation engine that recommends movies based on the similarities between movies.
The dataset can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

## Ongoing tasks
I am currently working on a flask-based web app to provide an user interface for the recommendation engine.
